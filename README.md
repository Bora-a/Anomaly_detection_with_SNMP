# Anomaly_detection_with_SNMP_
 Anomaly detection is performed by passing SNMP data through a deep learning model called an autoencoder. The autoencoder determines whether there is an anomaly by analyzing the reconstruction errors between the compressed and reconstructed forms of normal data samples. Large reconstruction errors indicate that the data is significantly different from the norm and may signal a potential anomaly. This system creates baseline values for normal behavior using time series analysis and flags data that deviates significantly from these baselines as outliers.
